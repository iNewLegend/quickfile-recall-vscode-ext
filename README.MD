# QuickFile Recall

QuickFile Recall is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you quickly reopen previously opened files from your editor history. It provides a searchable, timestamped list of your recent files, ensuring you never lose track of your workflowâ€”even across sessions.

## Features

- Tracks and stores a history of opened files, including timestamps.
- Command to quickly reopen previous files via a searchable list.
- Automatically removes non-existent files from history for reliability.
- Persists editor history across VS Code sessions.

## Usage

1. Open files as usual in VS Code.
2. Press `CMD+E` (Mac) or `CTRL+E` (Win/Linux) to quickly open QuickFile Recall, or use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:
   ```

   ```
   > On first activation, the extension will prompt you to set or override the shortcut if needed. You can also set your preferred shortcut via Keyboard Shortcuts (`Cmd+K Cmd+S`).
3. Select a file from the list to reopen it.
